Songza2Spotify
=============
Songza2Spotify is a chrome extension inspired by [8trhacker](https://github.com/Lukesed/8trhacker) that allows you to almost all the songs in a Songza playlist in Spotify. The extension embeds an "Open Current" button that opens your current song in Spotify and an "Open All" that opens all the songs that have already played in your Songza playlist and approximately the next 50 songs that will be played in the playlist (we unfortunately can't get all the songs since after a certain number of requests Songza starts rate limiting).
